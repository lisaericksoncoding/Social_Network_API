## Description 
  This Social Network API is for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. This API uses a NoSQL database so that the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.


## Installation
1. Hit the "Code" button within this GitHub repo to copy link
2. Within Bash, clone the repo using the copied link
3. Within the terminal, use the command "npm i" to install the necessary packages
4. Within the terminal, use the command "npm start". This should get the API server running on local port.

## Usage
Once the API server is running, open Insomnia. Paste the local host URL in the text input field. Utilize the API as needed for the POST, PUT, & DELETE routes for users, thoughts, or the POST & DELETE routes for a user’s friend list.
